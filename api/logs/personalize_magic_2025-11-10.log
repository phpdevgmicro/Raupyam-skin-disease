Your World's Whisper to Your Skin: How We Craft Smarter
We don't guess—we *get* your backdrop. Pulling live deets like:
- **Air Quality (AQI/PM2.5)**: Smog in **[CITY]**? Antioxidant armor (think liposome vitamin C—sips in protection without the weight).
- **Water Quality**: Mineral-heavy taps? Soothing hyaluronics to melt away that parched pull.
- **UV & Humidity**: Fierce rays or sticky air? Tailored shields—matte in the tropics, rich in the chill.
Blend with your age/gender/skin intel = your no-BS recipe. (E.g., 28yo oily type in sunny Sydney? Niacinamide gel with UV-synced mattifiers—clearer, bouncier by week 3.)
