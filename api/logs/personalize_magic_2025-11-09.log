Your World's Whisper to Your Skin: How We Craft Smarter
We don't guess—we *get* your backdrop. Pulling live deets like:
- **Air Quality (AQI/PM2.5)**: Moderate haze in **[CITY]**? Antioxidant armor (think liposome vitamin C—sips in protection without the weight).
- **Water Quality**: High minerals? Soothing hyaluronics to melt away that parched pull.
- **UV & Humidity**: Low rays in sticky air? Tailored shields—matte in the tropics, rich in the chill.
Blend with your age/gender/skin intel = your no-BS recipe. (E.g., 35yo combination type in rainy Seattle? Peptide emulsion with humectant layers—balanced, dewy by week 3.)
